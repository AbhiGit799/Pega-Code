Base64 Encoding:
Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format. It's commonly used to transmit binary data across channels that only reliably support text content. 
Pega Platform Usage:
Pega uses Base64 encoding for several purposes:
Storing objects in Rule-File-Binary rules. 
Storing file attachments to work objects. 
Storing scanned documents (TIFF images). 

Base64Encode() Function:
This function, part of the PegaRULES Default library, is used to convert objects to Base64 encoded strings. 

Base64Decode() Function:
To reverse the encoding process (converting a Base64 string back to the original data), you would use the Base64Decode() function

In summary, to encode data to Base64 in Pega, use the Base64Encode() function, which is part of the PegaRULES Default library. To decode, use the Base64Decode() function.
